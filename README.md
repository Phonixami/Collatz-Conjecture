Hello! this is a calculator for the 3X+1 (Collatz Conjecture) problem.
I've posted the source so you would have to either compile it using rustc or use the source with cargo.
You should run it in CMD. The results will be saved inside a txt file named "collatz".
be careful each time you run the script it'll replace the file with a new file so i would recommend that you save each txt file inside a seperate folder.
